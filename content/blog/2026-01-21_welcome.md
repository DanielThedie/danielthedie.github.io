# Welcome

My name is Daniel, welcome to my blog!

I will use this space to post updates about my work - new software, publications, or takeaways from conferences.

I am a Research Software Engineer (RSE) in the Biological Research Data Management team (BioRDM) at the University of Edinburgh. I have a multi-disciplinary background, ranging from biology, fluorescence and super-resolution microscopy, to data analysis and writing software. In my different roles, I have always enjoyed helping other researchers, whether by upgrading an in-house microscopy set-up, assisting with image acquisition, creating custom data analysis scripts, or teaching data management using git. I like transmitting knowledge, and I believe in hands-on teaching to empower researchers to be independent, from data collection to analysis and re-use.

My current work includes being a maintainer and developer for [BioDare2](https://biodare2.ed.ac.uk), and providing software support and data management training to the [Ambient-BD](https://ambientbd.com) project (including developing the [nocturn](https://nocturn.bio.ed.ac.uk) app for sleep data analysis).

I am strongly supportive of free, open-source software, and enthusiastic about projects that help reduce our dependency to proprietary tools.

I look forward to sharing more things here!
