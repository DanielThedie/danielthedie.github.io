      I studied the photophysics of fluorescent proteins to improve their use in single-molecule super-resolution techniques (like PALM/STORM). I started creating data anlysis scripts (mostly in Matlab) for my research, and to help others in the lab.

      After my PhD, I wanted to apply my knowledge of super-resolution microscopy to biological research. I moved to Edinburgh to study the repair of DNA double-strand breaks in <i>E.coli</i>. I developed my knowledge of image analysis and deep-learning, and created a Python package (PyBerries) to analyse tabular data from microscopy experiments.

      I am now working as a Research Software Engineer in the Biological Research Data Management team (BioRDM) at the University of Edinburgh. I enjoy making tools to help researchers manage and analyse their data. My activities in the team also include training researchers in data management and coding best practices.
